It seems like they have a stable life, both professionally and personally. Although the age and interest necessarily line with myself, I would give it a chance and at least like to connect via messaging\n",

      "6. [Reject] I chose not to connect with this person because of the location. It is a sit-down restaurant and typically, I go out to eat because I want to eat, not because I want to connect with a stranger. It feels like an odd place to try and meet somebody because a sit-down restaurant implies designated seating arrangement. I think it would be rude to just go up to a stranger in this place. Also, I would be intimidated to approach because the individual is there with a group of other people. I would feel hesitant to intrude on their time together. I would also be self-conscious because there would be an audience watching me if I attempt to connect to this person.\n",

      "\n",
      "22. [Reject] This decision is similar to the last; she is closer in age to my parents and I don't want to talk to someone close to my parents' age. I feel like we are at different places in life that would make it hard for me to want to relate to them because I could be as old as their kid.\n",

      "30. [Reject] Their age. In this case, I don't want to make friends with anybody whose age ends in -teen. It's just personal preference. They're younger than my sibling; I feel like I would end up babying them because we have an age gap.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "38. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Personality. I am also an introvert, and would still find it intimidating to approach and introduce myself to a more than one person at a time. Maybe if the cafe wasn't crowded, I could psyche myself up and be open to the potential of connecting in person with them and the other person. It wouldn't be as nerve-wracking as a group of people. I think chat would be easier, and I could use it as a segue to meet them in person because I can ask if I can go over to them.\n",

      "\n",
      "45. [Meet (in-person)] This person also seems to have a lot of similar interest with me and is closer to my age bracket. I personally am open to dating people ages, but the fact that this person is closer to my age bracket makes me more appealing as I think more too.\n",
      "\n",
      "46. [Chat (via instant messaging)] The person is with two to three other people. I would be intimidated by the group aspect and having to introduce myself and have an audience. The bar setting. I usually keep to myself and my friends when I go to the bar. \n",

      "53. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Although I like the list of hobbies and background of this person, there age is a little outside of what I would typically look for. Although I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker, I would still be open to chatting.\n",
      "\n",
      "54. [Chat (via instant messaging)] This is contradictory to past answers where I would not want to meet with someone close to my parents' age. Maybe it's because he is older, that I think of him closer to a cool grandpa figure I could learn about electronic music from and talk about collecting. The venue also makes me more willing to talk to this person because it could be an ice breaker. Maybe the age thing differs from somebody in their 50s because it is a holdover to how I befriended a lot of nontraditional students when I was in college and also my professors and guest lecturers.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "62. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Age. We are in a similar age range, so I think we could relate to each other a little easier. Venue. Again, I don't normally go up to another person's table when I am at a sit-down restaurant. It would be easier to chat in this scenario.\n",
      "\n",

My only negative is that I wish they were a bit taller as my preferences to people who are taller than me, however, that is not a dealbreaker, and I would still chat with him as I feel, we have many similar interests\n",
      "\n",
      "70. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Venue. It is a sit-down restaurant, and I stay in my lane and stay at my table with whoever I am with. Group aspect. It would be intimidating to introduce myself to one individual when they are hanging out with a group of people. Hobby. I like games, and I think it would be fun to get some recommendations on what video game or board game I should play.\n",

      "\n",
      "77. [Meet (in-person)] I also enjoy this profile, particularly the fact that he seems laid-back and dresses casually and isn’t too much. This profile comes off as if this person is laid-back, which is something that I look forward people I want to and hang out with.\n",
      "\n",
      "78. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Crowded and no music playing. I would feel so self-conscious if I went over to this person and everyone at the cafe could hear our conversation/me introducing myself to someone new. Maybe if there was music, I could convince myself that the music can obscure how nervous I would be. Hobby and interest. I like hiking, but never had friends who wanted to do that with me. It would be fun to have someone as enthusiastic about hiking as I am to hang out with.\n",
