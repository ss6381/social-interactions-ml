Maybe if the cafe wasn't crowded, I could psyche myself up and be open to the potential of connecting in person with them and the other person. It wouldn't be as nerve-wracking as a group of people.

      "96. [Chat (via instant messaging)] This is contradictory to past answers where I would not want to meet with someone close to my parents' age. Maybe it's because he is older, that I think of him closer to a cool grandpa figure I could learn about electronic music from and talk about collecting. The venue also makes me more willing to talk to this person because it could be an ice breaker.

I would feel so self-conscious if I went over to this person and everyone at the cafe could hear our conversation/me introducing myself to someone new. Maybe if there was music, I could convince myself that the music can obscure how nervous I would be. Hobby and interest. I like hiking, but never had friends who wanted to do that with me.
