Could you summarize the reasons that people choose to "Meet in person", "Chat via instant messaging", or "Reject". The reasons should be ordered by how frequently they are mentioned, and the results should be split up by each response type ("Meet in person", "Chat via instant messaging", and "Reject").

***SURVEY RESPONSES BELOW***
1. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Considering she is an introvert, chatting online would seem to be an easier means of getting to know that person without making it awkward for myself and them.

2. [Reject] I have nothing against them or any of their characteristics; I'm just not that social of a person, so I probably wouldn't make an effort to meet or online chat with someone except in rare cases.

3. [Reject] I would not pursue a friendship with anyone on that format. Strangers at a restaurant don't want to be my friend they want to eat lunch

4. [Reject] I wouldn't decide to start interacting with a stranger outside of the context of a shared identity, a hobby group, or some other proximity like being neighbors or working together

5. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I like that this person seems like a go-getter and has some personal interest that there are suing. It seems like they have a stable life, both professionally and personally. Although the age and interest necessarily line with myself, I would give it a chance and at least like to connect via messaging

6. [Reject] I chose not to connect with this person because of the location. It is a sit-down restaurant and typically, I go out to eat because I want to eat, not because I want to connect with a stranger. It feels like an odd place to try and meet somebody because a sit-down restaurant implies designated seating arrangement. I think it would be rude to just go up to a stranger in this place. Also, I would be intimidated to approach because the individual is there with a group of other people. I would feel hesitant to intrude on their time together. I would also be self-conscious because there would be an audience watching me if I attempt to connect to this person.

7. [Chat (via instant messaging)] their occupation

8. [Meet (in-person)] had a lot of the same interests as me

9. [Meet (in-person)] I lean to the hobbies that this person chooses and think that meeting in person would be far easier to get to know them as a person.

10. [Meet (in-person)] Since they are alone, I wouldn't mind having a conversation with this person about creative arts hobbies, literature, or YouTube. It seems like we have some similar interests.

11. [Reject] Again I would be uncomfortable starting a friendship with somebody who was trying to eat lunch / breakfast because I feel like I was bothering them. Although he sounds interesting and I would hope that a chance encounter would have him introduce himself to me

12. [Reject] I think I would have almost nothing in common with this person

13. [Meet (in-person)] Relate to this person’s similar interest in music and creative arts. Their age and physical characteristics are also more my type and closer to my own demographic.

14. [Reject] I would reject this person because of their age. It is unfair, but he's also as old as my parents. I don't want to hang out with someone who could be my dad.

15. [Meet (in-person)] because of their hobby and interests, very simiiar to mine

16. [Meet (in-person)] already there so why not meet him

17. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Given their lack of employment and obsession with rock, I would find it easier to converse with online via chat.

18. [Reject] I have some similar interests with this person, but since they are already talking to others, I probably wouldn't take an interest in talking with them.

19. [Reject] If some strange encounter had us talking I would prefer to do it on chat however I would not instigate a conversation with the stranger

20. [Reject] I don't have a reason to form a connection with this person

21. [Chat (via instant messaging)] The fact that this person is not currently employed was a bit of a red flag, but I did appreciate their hobbies and creative that show to me that they have intrinsic passions for other things

22. [Reject] This decision is similar to the last; she is closer in age to my parents and I don't want to talk to someone close to my parents' age. I feel like we are at different places in life that would make it hard for me to want to relate to them because I could be as old as their kid.

23. [Meet (in-person)] because of their hobby and the fact they have tatoos as i do

24. [Reject] person is not employed

25. [Meet (in-person)] I would be intrigued by someone so young that already holds a bachelor's degree and a job. Plus they love games.

26. [Reject] She is a rather young and already in a bit group, so I probably wouldn't be particularly interested in talking to her.

27. [Reject] They have too many people in their circle so even if I was going to approach them which is highly unlikely I would not do it when they were busy with friends

28. [Reject] I probably would not seek out friendship with a teenager outside of a mentorship position within a volunteer organization

29. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Although this person is a bit young for me, I would still give them a chance by chatting online as I try to always give people a chance unless there are any true deal breakers listed

30. [Reject] Their age. In this case, I don't want to make friends with anybody whose age ends in -teen. It's just personal preference. They're younger than my sibling; I feel like I would end up babying them because we have an age gap.

31. [Reject] nothing in common

32. [Meet (in-person)] sounds like a interesting person

33. [Meet (in-person)] I am intrigued by this person's hobbies and interests so I would prefer to meet in person.

34. [Meet (in-person)] I would wonder why she is looking at me. I would maybe be interested in talking with her about creative hobbies or literature, since those are shared interests.

35. [Reject] I would not approach anyone in public that I didn't know and try to become their friend or strike up a conversation

36. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Given her age and combination of interests and introversion, we may be romantically compatible

37. [Meet (in-person)] This person seems to be more like what I personally look for in a partner, and I relate to their list of hobbies interests, and I also enjoy that they are closer to my age level and will be easier to relate to 

38. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Personality. I am also an introvert, and would still find it intimidating to approach and introduce myself to a more than one person at a time. Maybe if the cafe wasn't crowded, I could psyche myself up and be open to the potential of connecting in person with them and the other person. It wouldn't be as nerve-wracking as a group of people. I think chat would be easier, and I could use it as a segue to meet them in person because I can ask if I can go over to them.

39. [Chat (via instant messaging)] the fact hat they have a tatoo and we have similiar hobbys

40. [Meet (in-person)] sounds smart and has some of the same interests

41. [Reject] I wouldn't be interest in chatting up with this person as I am not into men.

42. [Reject] He is already in too big of a group for me to take much interest.

43. [Reject] Same reasoning as the last five. I would just not approach somebody in public with the hopes of striking up a random conversation

44. [Meet (in-person)] Based on his age, interests, earrings, and ambiversion, we may be romantically compatible.

45. [Meet (in-person)] This person also seems to have a lot of similar interest with me and is closer to my age bracket. I personally am open to dating people ages, but the fact that this person is closer to my age bracket makes me more appealing as I think more too.

46. [Chat (via instant messaging)] The person is with two to three other people. I would be intimidated by the group aspect and having to introduce myself and have an audience. The bar setting. I usually keep to myself and my friends when I go to the bar. 

47. [Meet (in-person)] their clothing choices

48. [Reject] sounds a little too kick back for me

49. [Reject] Given their age and gender, I would not find much interest in meeting up with men, regardless of their interests or hobbies.

50. [Meet (in-person)] I would wonder why this person is looking at me, and would maybe be open to talking about arts and literature with him.

51. [Reject] See the last eight?

52. [Reject] This person is older than my father and I don't know him, I don't have a reason to make a connection.

53. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Although I like the list of hobbies and background of this person, there age is a little outside of what I would typically look for. Although I wouldn’t say it’s a dealbreaker, I would still be open to chatting.

54. [Chat (via instant messaging)] This is contradictory to past answers where I would not want to meet with someone close to my parents' age. Maybe it's because he is older, that I think of him closer to a cool grandpa figure I could learn about electronic music from and talk about collecting. The venue also makes me more willing to talk to this person because it could be an ice breaker. Maybe the age thing differs from somebody in their 50s because it is a holdover to how I befriended a lot of nontraditional students when I was in college and also my professors and guest lecturers.

55. [Meet (in-person)] similar hobby and college degree

56. [Reject] doesn't sound like someone I would like that much

57. [Chat (via instant messaging)] This is probably someone I would want to get to know better at a distance via online chat before I decide to meet them in person.

58. [Reject] I would wonder why she is looking at me, but she is in a large group, which I wouldn't really want to deal with.

59. [Reject] Because she is in public trying to do something other than strike up a random conversation with a stranger. And she sounds boring

60. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I think this may be an interesting friend to chat with due to her proclivity for reading, line of work, and musical interests.

61. [Meet (in-person)] Although this person is still a little younger than what I would typically look for in a person, there are no other dealbreaker and I enjoy mine. Enjoy reading and music.

62. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Age. We are in a similar age range, so I think we could relate to each other a little easier. Venue. Again, I don't normally go up to another person's table when I am at a sit-down restaurant. It would be easier to chat in this scenario.

63. [Reject] too young to start a conversation or relationship with

64. [Reject] very different from me

65. [Reject] Not interested in meeting men, especially anyone that favors metal.

66. [Meet (in-person)] Him being with a medium-sized group would make me hesitate, but we have a lot of similar interests and other similarities, so I would be interested in talking to him about those things - especially about work.

67. [Reject] If I was going to have a conversation with a complete stranger I guess it would be this one however unless she approached me I would not strike up a conversation with a complete stranger

68. [Reject] I would probably not trust a metal head gamer

69. [Meet (in-person)] I love all of the characteristics listed of this particular person. My only negative is that I wish they were a bit taller as my preferences to people who are taller than me, however, that is not a dealbreaker, and I would still chat with him as I feel, we have many similar interests

70. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Venue. It is a sit-down restaurant, and I stay in my lane and stay at my table with whoever I am with. Group aspect. It would be intimidating to introduce myself to one individual when they are hanging out with a group of people. Hobby. I like games, and I think it would be fun to get some recommendations on what video game or board game I should play.

71. [Meet (in-person)] their interests, clothing and hobby choices

72. [Reject] not employed

73. [Reject] Another male so I would decline to meet or chat with them.

74. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Since I also use Reddit a lot, I wouldn't mind talking with him about animals or something like that (our shared interest) on Reddit.

75. [Reject] This man would like to drink his cup of coffee not be bothered by my awkward attempts at conversation

76. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I think because he's my age and into nature we could have things to chat about.

77. [Meet (in-person)] I also enjoy this profile, particularly the fact that he seems laid-back and dresses casually and isn’t too much. This profile comes off as if this person is laid-back, which is something that I look forward people I want to and hang out with.

78. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Crowded and no music playing. I would feel so self-conscious if I went over to this person and everyone at the cafe could hear our conversation/me introducing myself to someone new. Maybe if there was music, I could convince myself that the music can obscure how nervous I would be. Hobby and interest. I like hiking, but never had friends who wanted to do that with me. It would be fun to have someone as enthusiastic about hiking as I am to hang out with.

79. [Meet (in-person)] their interests and hobby choices

80. [Chat (via instant messaging)] not sure if my type

81. [Meet (in-person)] One they sound friendly enough, they like gaming which I personally like, and I think we'd have fun chatting a bit. 

82. [Meet (in-person)] Currently employed, likes games, food and drink

83. [Chat (via instant messaging)] We have a lot in common but it is not enough for me to approach them in person.

84. [Chat (via instant messaging)] hobbies and personality

85. [Chat (via instant messaging)] We had some similarities regarding work and interests as well as age. 

86. [Chat (via instant messaging)] he may be interesting and educated

87. [Meet (in-person)] They're already nearby and we're in a social atmosphere, so it wouldn't hurt to try to meet that person and see what they're like. If they're up to it, maybe they could join our meeting and become part of the group.

88. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Non confrontational first impressions

89. [Meet (in-person)] I think I'd have fun learning about her and her history on this planet. I'd enjoy the conversation and asking her about her life and what games she enjoys now as she's older versus when she was younger. 

90. [Meet (in-person)] Similar to my age

91. [Reject] Too old for me to get to know them.

92. [Reject] Personality and too  much older than me

93. [Reject] Mostly the age of the individual made me chose to reject. 

94. [Meet (in-person)] educated and long red hair, like me and near my age

95. [Reject] In this case, while it is a social atmosphere and it would be easy to meet this person, they are most likely already there with friends seeing as how they're an extrovert. Also, the age gap between us is pretty significant (about 40 years).

96. [Reject] Age gap is a little too wide

97. [Meet (in-person)] I think she'd be fun to chat with in person to get to know what she's like. We may not entirely jive on some matters but it would be a lot of fun to see where she is coming from versus where I am coming from. 

98. [Reject] She is too young, and her music and social media don't mesh with mine.

99. [Meet (in-person)] I would be willing to approach this person in the gym since we have a lot in common.

100. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Want to know more about them

101. [Meet (in-person)] This person seems similar to me and the environment warrants an in person meeting. 

102. [Chat (via instant messaging)] sounds like a nice person due to her age and education

103. [Meet (in-person)] Since we're already in public and in an atmosphere conducive to meeting, I would opt to meet this person. They also match a lot of my characteristics, are in my age range, and we have some similar interests.

104. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Non confrontational first impression

105. [Reject] I honestly think we would both be absolutely miserable in trying to get to know the other person. Also he was surrounded by people which would make any conversation nigh impossible. 

106. [Reject] Too young, likes Pop

107. [Chat (via instant messaging)] We have a lot in common but too young to be part of my group of friends

108. [Meet (in-person)] This person is EXTREMELY similar to me. At workplace so no safety concerns

109. [Reject] They are currently already engaged in conversation .

110. [Reject] i dont seem to like the same things as him or reddit 

111. [Reject] I would probably avoid this mainly because the individual is already with a group of people and I'd rather not interrupt. Further, the age gap between us (about 14 years) makes some friendships at that point a little difficult.

112. [Meet (in-person)] Workplace relationships can help career

113. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I think an instant message chat would be a good way to engage with her to start. As she is more introverted it would be a good way to ease into an in person meeting. I think we'd have a lot of fun chatting though. 

114. [Reject] Too young and likes Pop

115. [Meet (in-person)] Educational background and hobbies

116. [Chat (via instant messaging)] around my age and similar interests

117. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Not many people are talking so I wouldn't want to meet in person but I'd like to chat due to similarity in interests.

118. [Reject] she sounds like too young of a person for me, not interested in the same things or interests

119. [Meet (in-person)] We're in public in a relatively social atmosphere and the age difference, while significant, is not too bad. It seems like we have a lot of the same interests so I would opt to meet this person even though it's raining. I would wait until it's somewhere clear of the rain.

120. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Non confrontational first
Inpression

121. [Meet (in-person)] Oh this guy sounds like a blast to chat with, I could learn a lot about home improvement and DIY from him. I think chatting music and gaming with him would be a lot of fun. He just seems like a fairly chilled guy. 

122. [Meet (in-person)] Currently employed, likes games

123. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I would probably talk to him about business since we took the same major

124. [Reject] Age difference gap is too big for me

125. [Reject] The Restaurant does not seem like a place to meet a new person. 

126. [Reject] sounds too young for me to be interested in visiting with and his interests are very different

127. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I would not interrupt this person's dinner with their friends, but I would try to connect with them since we're the same age, share the same interests, and generally appear to have similar lifestyles. 

128. [Meet (in-person)] Dinner setting makes sense to meet

129. [Meet (in-person)] Oh I want to get to know her, she sounds like fun! I'd love to ask her questions about her career and what lead to her going into Health care. She also likes creativity which would give us endless coversations, so I'd love it. 

130. [Reject] Creative arts and Pop

131. [Meet (in-person)] Educational background at a young age

132. [Chat (via instant messaging)] We can get to know each other better. We may find common ground based on her interests and hobbies.

133. [Meet (in-person)] There seems to be am environment where people are mingling so I'd meet her in person. 

134. [Chat (via instant messaging)] she seems to be someone i would visit with a little

135. [Chat (via instant messaging)] This person is with a group and I would not want to interrupt. But they are more age appropriate, we share a lot of interests such as the creative arts, and we go to the same school.

136. [Meet (in-person)] Group setting easier to navigate 

137. [Meet (in-person)] SInce they are looking at me I figure I could hang out. They are a bit introverted so it could be hard to get him to open up but given time we could have fun hanging. They like a lot of what I'm into so I'd be down. 

138. [Reject] Too young, likes Rock and uses Reddit

139. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Same hobbies and I would have a conversation about Reddit

140. [Reject] Big age difference

141. [Meet (in-person)] A bar environment seems fair game to chat with anyone who I'd have similarities with. 

142. [Chat (via instant messaging)] he may be interestng to visit with due to his interests in drawing and painting and music

143. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I would not opt to meet this person in public because they are already with a group of people. But we're the same age and share similar interests, so it would be good to at least try to connect.

144. [Meet (in-person)] Bar group setting easy to navigate

145. [Reject] I don't think it would work out. She seems nice enough but honestly she's not into a lot of what I'm into so I don't think the vibe would mesh at all. 

146. [Meet (in-person)] My age, likes reading and religion

147. [Reject] Too old to consider as someone to befriend or get to know more

148. [Reject] Age difference gap too large

149. [Reject] A restaurant does not seem like an appropriate place to meet new people. 

150. [Meet (in-person)] this person is near my age and may have some ofmy same intrst; i am retired and have bachelors degree

151. [Reject] Aside from the significant age gap, I do not have too many interests in common with this person. I am, for example, not religious, so we probably wouldn't connect on too many other things.

152. [Reject] Age gap to wide

153. [Meet (in-person)] Yeah I'd be down to hang with him! He sounds cool, right around my age and seems like an easy person to talk with. I'd love it. 

154. [Reject] Interests are arts and literature, Rock music

155. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I listen to a lot of rock and would ask for recommendations

156. [Reject] Age difference again too big

157. [Reject] Again, the location does not warrant meeting amd talking to new people. 

158. [Chat (via instant messaging)] he may be interesting to visit iwth due to his music type and is educated

159. [Chat (via instant messaging)] It might be worth getting to know this person digitally first. We don't have too many things in common, but the things we do are significant enough to see if there would be an opportunity for a good friendship. Also they're with others, so I would not interrupt.

160. [Chat (via instant messaging)]   Non confrontational firet
Impression

161. [Meet (in-person)] Music genre, gender 

162. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I like to give people a chance to connect, regardless of background.  You never know...

163. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Personality

164. [Meet (in-person)] We have a lot in common.

165. [Meet (in-person)] We both have the same interests and seem to have a lot in common. We both have tattoos and similar music tastes. Chat would have been ok but when connecting you can only talk so much before wanting to meet them in person.

166. [Reject] I’m married and 20 years older.

167. [Reject] Age, sit down restaurant 

168. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I get along well with other creatives.

169. [Meet (in-person)] Personality

170. [Reject] We don't have much in common.

171. [Meet (in-person)] This connect s closer to my age which means she probably likes the way things used to be. No swiping left or right. Actually meeting someone out instead of chat. 

172. [Meet (in-person)] Age and I’m going to assume we’re both single. 

173. [Reject] Unable to see them, age

174. [Reject] I'm not seeking to make connections with other males at this time.

175. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Personality

176. [Reject] He's much older than me.

177. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I picked chat as the way to meet him because I could see being friends with him as we have a lot in common. Again were pretty close n age and he seems interesting. Chat would keep the friends vibe going without leading on. 

178. [Reject] Sexual orientation not a match

179. [Meet (in-person)] Genre, hobby, bar setting 

180. [Reject] I'm not seeking to make connections with other males at this time.

181. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Personality

186. [Reject] I'm not seeking to make connections with other males at this time.

187. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Personality

188. [Reject] Not my style of person

189. [Reject] I just feel this wouldn't be a good match because of too many differences. The big one though would be the style of music he likes. I'm not a metalhead. Sorry!

190. [Reject] Different sexual orientation 

191. [Reject] Age, gender, sit down setting

192. [Reject] I'm not seeking to make connections with other males at this time.

193. [Meet (in-person)] Personality

194. [Reject] Quite a bit older than me

195. [Chat (via instant messaging)] This guy has enough qualities that I would find him to be a good friend. The style of music is country which is great and could fit. He also seems outgoing so he would be able to keep up in a chat conversation

196. [Reject] Different sexual orientation 

197. [Reject] Age, gym setting, gender 

198. [Reject] I'm not seeking to make connections with other males at this time.

199. [Meet (in-person)] Personality

200. [Reject] Much older than me

201. [Meet (in-person)] I would meet this guy in a heartbeat! Holy Knight! You literally described me. From the age, education, appearance and likes you literally described me.. Wow kind cool but kinda scary..But to the point, he seems like a great guy with a lot to offer so meeting in person would be the way to go.

202. [Reject] Different sexual orientation 

203. [Chat (via instant messaging)] No matter what the person looks like or what their demographics are, I will always choose to chat via instant messaging first to gage whether or not we are compatible.

204. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Personality and favorite music genre. 

205. [Reject] We are at work, from my point of view we are both there to work and not meet new people.

208. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Favorite hobby and personality type. 

209. [Reject] I am not interested in meeting new people at work unless it is work related.

210. [Reject] I made my decision because I wouldn't have a lot in common with this person. I am not into outdoor activities.

211. [Chat (via instant messaging)] They seem to be introverted since they are  in a group but only listening... which I am attracted to in a friend.

212. [Meet (in-person)] Personality, favorite music genre, and location. 

213. [Reject] Not currently employed, can't support themselves

214. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I made my decision because she seems interesting. I like that she also likes listening to rock.

215. [Reject] She seems too outgoing for my liking.

216. [Reject] age difference 

217. [Reject] Age difference is significant

218. [Reject] I would reject because I don't have a lot in common with this person. I don't play many video games or other kinds of games. I also don't like to travel.

219. [Chat (via instant messaging)] He sounds like an introvert for sure. I wouldn't mind getting to know him through chat first. 

220. [Chat (via instant messaging)] hobby and music

221. [Reject] I am not interested in politics nor do I want to hear about it

222. [Reject] I would reject this person because he seems nice but I am not into politics. I also don't like outdoor activities.

223. [Chat (via instant messaging)] He seems like a nice person. Introverted, likes hiking, classic rock... I would definitely want to get to know him.

224. [Meet (in-person)] Hobby, music, interest, and location. 

225. [Chat (via instant messaging)] Similar industry, see where he works

226. [Chat (via instant messaging)] I wouldn't mind chatting with this person because I wouldn't want to meet in person, but I would like to get to know them better through chat. I like that his favorite social media is Reddit and that he is an introvert.
